# 1, Glossary:

Application - foremost layer that is used to install the applications in the devices.
Application Framework - It is the third layer. It serves the services to the
application layer in the form of java classes.
Activity - Activity is an application component that provides a screen with which
users can interact in order to do something
Codeline - Codeline contains the release of a software product. It consists of one
or more branches from one or more repositories, all of which are often under active
development at once.
Debugging - Debugging requires finding and fixing errors in Android platform
code, either in features or their tests.

GIT - The source control tool used by Android that historically operated on a
single Git repository.

GIT Repository - Sometimes referred to as a project, this is a portion of the
codebase representing a particular component or type of device

Layout Resources - An XML file that describes the layout of an Activity screen.
Resources- Nonprogrammatic application components that are external to the
compiled application code, but which can be loaded from application code using a
well-known reference format.

Repo - A wrapper around Git to allow easier operations on multiple Git
repositories. It aggregates and manages the many Git repositories as a singular
checkout or codebase.

Theme - A set of properties (text size, background color, and so on) bundled
together to define various default display settings.

URI - URI (uniform resource identifier) strings as the basis for requesting data in a 
content provider (such as to retrieve a list of contacts) and for requesting actions in
an Intent (such as opening a Web page in a browser).

View - An object that draws to a rectangular area on the screen and handles click,
keystroke, and other interaction events. A view is a base class for most layout
components of an Activity or Dialog screen (text boxes, windows, and so on).
